amaranth README

Amaranth is a minimal command line music player which I created for my own
amusement and as a programming challenge during the Christmas 2009, not
intended to be anything big or versatile.  It is able to play various kinds
of music formats, including but not limited to WAV, Ogg Vorbis and MP3.  I
have also plans to implement a feature to allow Amaranth to stream music
directly from the Internet by using HTTP and FTP protocols.

Amaranth is named after the Nightwish song of the same name.  Enjoy!
